# Personalised covid-19 smart assistant

Chatbot solution which provides generic covid-19 related data across the world along with user specific data depending on where the user is at the moment. This implementation uses GPS/Location services to provide information about the number of cases reported nearby, test centers/labs accessible, local helpline numbers or the kind of zone the user is in (red/orange/green/containment zone). The chatbot can double as a smart health assistant by providing users with real time assistance in case it detects an anomaly in the user's health data like body temperature recently. This is achieved by integrating the chatbot with a IoT enabled device.
